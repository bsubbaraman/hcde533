  <h2> concept</h2>
  I've been playing around a bit with 3D printing structures that might be a bit difficult or a pain to print with a Rhino to Cura workflow. For example, single line width spirals like this:

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="gallery">
  <img class="fig_img" src="./images/experiments-in-z.gif">
  <span class="post-meta center"> sped up 20x </a>  </span>
  </div>
  <br/><br/>

This meant a lot of fiddling with flow rates and speeds; for the above I generated GCode from a grasshopper python script, omitting Cura entirely. This was an annoyingly laborious process. I think it would be fun to be able
to play around with direct gcode manipulation to better explore these sorts of prints. I'm taking LIA's 2014 <a href="https://www.liaworks.com/theprojects/filament-sculptures/"> filament sculptures </a> as inspiration here, too.

<span class="post-meta center"> from LIA's 2014 <a href="https://www.liaworks.com/theprojects/filament-sculptures/"> filament sculptures </a> </span>
</div>
<br/><br/>

To play around with this, for my final project I propose <b> generating GCode from <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js </a></b> to make <b>a set of 3 generative vases </b>. For the three vases,
my goal is to have:
<ol>
  <li> one be something that would also be easy to recreate in Rhino (e.g. a box)</li>
  <li> the other two be less easy to accomplish via Rhino/Cura (e.g. single line extrusions, something more like Cura's wireprint mode)  </li>
</ol>

In lieu of a rendering, here's brief look at what I've set up thus far, which uses wired serial communication from my laptop to my ender to format Marlin flavor GCode:

  <h2> contingency plans</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> the most hazy element right now is sending gcode directly from p5 to the printer. if i drop this element and instead generate gcode that i print from an sd card, things should be totally doable </li>
    <li> as of now, i'm hoping to print more than 3 vases; but if need be, I can design and print fewer (i.e 2).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> materials </h2>
  I've got all the materials I need for this! I might, however, order another color filament, an order I will place by the end of this week if I choose to proceed.
